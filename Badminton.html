  <h2>My favorite sport in the whole wide world is BADMINTON! I love badminton as much as I love my hamster, and I love my hamster a LOT! I have been playiing badminton for 5 years. I started by playing with my friends but then I started to take the sport more seriously. I took classes for 2 years and then quit because I joined an elite intermediate badminton team at Bintang Badminton Academy. I played badminton at Cupertino Sports Center and at Bintang. I recentely got injured after falling over my ankle three times. Whenever you play a sport with full dedication, you are literally signing up for getting hurt.</h2>
