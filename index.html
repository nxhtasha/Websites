        <h3>Hi guys, my name is Natasha Kulkarni and I am building my very first webpage right here. I am a middle schooler who attends Miller Middle School. I love to program and I already know four different coding lnaguages - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. I also have a pet hamster named Misty who turned one on January 29th. She is a very playful pet and always loves to get attention. I am also a huge Golden State Warrioirs fan. Stephen Curry is one of the best players:). He is literally my idol. I also love soccer, and I support FC Barcelona (club team) and Agentina (national team). This is just some basic information about me!!!</h3>
