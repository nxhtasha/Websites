<h2>Hello! My name is Natasha Kulkarni and this is my very first website. I am currentely 13 years old and officially an eighth grader at Joaquin Miller MIddle School! I was born in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. We moved to California right after I was born and stayed here. I went to L.P. Collins Elementary School for kindergarten to fifth grade Then for sixth grade, I went to Sam H. Lawsom Middle School. We bought a house here in San Jose, so I have to change schools and went to Joaquin Miller Middle School. TBH, THIS WAS THE BEST ONE YEAR OF MY LIFE!!! Everyone is so nice and super chill at Miller. The teachers there are super awesome and are very helpful. Stay cool Miller!</h2>
